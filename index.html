  <h2> My thoughts about GitHub.</h2>
  <p>I am excited to use GitHub because I have a friend who is a computer programmer. He said the only way to become a good programmer is to look at a lot of code. GitHub is a place where I can do that effectively. I am driven to become a great programmer and I hope I can start by using GitHub.</p>
